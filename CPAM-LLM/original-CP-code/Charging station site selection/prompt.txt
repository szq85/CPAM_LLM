Specific Description: 

Constraint 1: Full Demand Coverage - Each defined demand area (e.g., residential areas, commercial centers, transportation hubs, etc.) has its predicted charging demand;

Constraint 2: Site Capacity Limitation - Each candidate site has its maximum service capacity limit;

Constraint 3: Optimization Objective - Minimize the sum of the fixed construction costs of all operational sites and the total service cost for all users to determine where to build charging stations.





New Demands:
Demand areas expanded from 30 to 40;
Transportation costs between any demand area and its assigned charging station must not exceed 20;
The sum of the fixed costs of all newly built charging stations must be strictly controlled within the budget range of 20,000 to 25,000;
The actual load of all operational charging stations must not exceed 90% of their total design capacity;
Only one site can be built if the distance between any two candidate sites is no more than 10.
For any two candidate sites with the most similar cost characteristics (ranked in the nearest 10% of all site pairs), only one site can be built.
